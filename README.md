# pypi-download-stats
Notebooks to plot download stats for PyPI packages.

Initially, the stats have been computed only for packages from the Stegle lab; you can find that code in [this tagged commit](https://github.com/PMBio/pypi-download-stats/releases/tag/stegle-lab-methods).

Now, the stats are computed for the scverse core packages.
